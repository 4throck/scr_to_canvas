Standard ZX Spectrum screen

The original ZX Spectrum has a screen resolution of 256×192 pixels.
Colour information is overlaid onto this as a grid of 8×8 pixel regions known as attribute blocks; within each attribute block, only two colours may be used out of a palette of 8 (black, blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, yellow and white).
Additionally, the entire attribute block may be designated as 'bright', resulting in a total of 15 possible colours (because both bright and dark black is the same color #000000).
In many programs this limitation was evident as attribute clash.

Details: Pixels: 256 × 192
Attributes: 32 × 24
Colors: 15
